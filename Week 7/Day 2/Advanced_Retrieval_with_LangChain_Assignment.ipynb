That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

Therefore, I think both `contextual_compression_retrieval_chain` and `ensemble_retrieval_chain` could be good candidates for this type of data, which makes sense again our SDG questions are generally short so `multi_query_retrieval_chain` wouldn't make a lot of sense. Our contexts are individual reviews and thus they are also short, `parent_document_retrieval_chain` wouldn't really help much in this case.\n",
