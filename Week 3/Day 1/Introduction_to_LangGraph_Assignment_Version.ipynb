QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model like BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and relevant information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model (such as GPT-3, BERT, or T5) uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to additional information from the retrieval step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the input query is complex or requires specific knowledge that may not be fully captured by the generative model alone. By incorporating external information through retrieval, RAG can enhance the performance of NLP systems in tasks like question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation.'"

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval, such as keyword matching, semantic search, or more advanced methods like dense retrieval using embeddings.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system generates a response based on the retrieved information and the input query. It typically uses a language model, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to produce coherent and contextually appropriate text.\\n\\n### How RAG Works\\n\\n1. **Input Query**: The system receives an input query from the user.\\n2. **Retrieval Phase**: The retrieval component searches a large database or corpus to find the most relevant documents or pieces of information related to the query.\\n3. **Augmentation Phase**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input query, providing additional context and details.\\n4. **Generation Phase**: The generation component uses the augmented query to generate a response. The language model takes into account both the original query and the retrieved information to produce a more accurate and informative answer.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG\\n\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By incorporating relevant information from a large corpus, the system can generate responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate.\\n- **Knowledge Integration**: The system can leverage external knowledge sources, making it more knowledgeable and capable of answering a wider range of questions.\\n- **Flexibility**: RAG systems can be applied to various tasks, including question answering, summarization, and conversational agents.\\n\\n### Applications\\n\\n- **Customer Support**: Providing accurate and contextually relevant answers to customer queries.\\n- **Educational Tools**: Assisting students with detailed and informative responses to their questions.\\n- **Content Creation**: Helping writers and content creators generate high-quality text based on specific topics or queries.\\n\\nOverall, Retrieval Augmented Generation systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods, resulting in more effective and intelligent AI systems.\",\n",

Here are some key advancements:\\n\\n1. **Communication Efficiency**:\\n   - **Federated LoRA with Sparse Communication (FLASC)**: This approach applies sparsity to LoRA during communication, allowing clients to locally fine-tune the entire LoRA module. It achieves up to 10 times less communication while maintaining performance comparable to dense LoRA. This method also offers benefits in terms of heterogeneity and privacy.\\n\\n2. **Cost-Effective and Flexible Implementation**:\\n   - **Open LoRa for IoT**: This design and implementation allow users to build private LoRa networks for various IoT applications conveniently. The improved software architecture of the LoRa network server, which is open-source, ensures scalability and flexibility. The server is divided into four decoupled modules and uses a messaging system based on streaming data for interaction between modules.\\n\\n3. **Energy Efficiency and Large-Scale Deployment**:\\n   - **LoRa Networking for IoT**: LoRa networks meet the key requirements of IoT applications, such as low cost, large-scale deployment, and high energy efficiency. This makes it suitable for applications like smart cities and precision agriculture. The open standard of LoRa allows for the development of autonomous LPWAN networks without third-party infrastructure.\\n\\nThese improvements highlight the importance of considering system-specific constraints and the potential for LoRA to be a competitive baseline for future work in federated finetuning and IoT applications.',\n",
